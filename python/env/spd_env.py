"""Gymnasium environment wrapper for Shattered Pixel Dungeon.

This module contains a minimal skeleton of the `SPDEnv` class used to
interface between the Java game (running in headless mode) and the
reinforcement learning algorithms.  You will need to implement methods to
launch the game process, send actions over a socket or pipe, and receive
observations (e.g. pixel arrays) and additional info from the game.

The environment should follow the Gymnasium API: `reset()` to start a new
episode and `step(action)` to advance the game by one action.  It should
return observations, rewards, termination flags and any extra information.
